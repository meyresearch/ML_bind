The miniconda environment containing the AmberTools 20.15 package must be activated.

The following commands were issued to parse a full 6 ns trajectory containing 60,000 frames into 600 frames by taking every 100th frame. The inputs were the solvated complex topology file (solvated_complex.prmtop) and the simulation trajectory file (production.mdcrd). The shortened trajectory was saved as production_short.mdcrd.
