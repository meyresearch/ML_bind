The miniconda environment containing the AmberTools 20.15 package must be activated.

The following commands were issued to obtain a single frame (frame 300) in pdb format from a shortened, 600 frame trajectory. The inputs were the solvated complex topology file (solvated_complex.prmtop) and the shortened simulation trajectory file (production_short.mdcrd). The single frame was saved as production_frame300.pdb.
